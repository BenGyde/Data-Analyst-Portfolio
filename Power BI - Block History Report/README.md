# Block History Report using Power BI

## Problem statement

End users receive two separate reports, both containing essential data needed for their workflow. Manually combining and analyzing these reports is time-consuming and prone to error.

## Solution & Features

- **Data Integration**: Combines both source reports into a single, consolidated dataset.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Applies user-requested cleaning and transformations to standardize fields and remove duplicates/inconsistencies.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Provides deeper understanding of customer blocks, their history, and the frequency of blocks.
- **User-Friendly Report**: Summarizes important account information in a clear, actionable format.
