# Power BI Embedded Power App for Bulk Customer Filtering & CSV Export

## Problem Statement

Collections teams often need to work with large sets of customer accounts to manage overdue balances and claims. Manually filtering these accounts in Power BI or preparing bulk upload files for third-party platforms is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution & Features

- **Bulk Account Filtering**: Users can copy-paste a large list of customer IDs into the embedded Power App, which dynamically filters the Power BI table.
- **Integrated Data View**: The filtered table displays key details such as:
  - Total overdue amount
  - Customer phone number
- **Automated CSV Generation**:
  - **Claims.csv**: Generates a file with all required fields for claims upload.
  - **Debts.csv**: Generates a file for debt upload to external platforms.
- **Seamless Workflow**: Combines Power BI visualization with Power App interactivity for a single, streamlined process.
