# Projects Inventory

## Problem Statement

As digital solutions grow across teams, it's essential to maintain a centralized, up-to-date record of all projects. Tracking who built what, for whom, and the current status helps ensure continuity, accountability, and efficient supportâ€”especially for critical tools.

## Solution & Features
- **Project Registry**: An Excel-based table that logs each digital project with key metadata including creator, requester, stage, criticality, location, and backup person.
- **Smart Filtering**: A built-in VBA-powered search bar allows users to quickly locate projects by keyword.
- **Maintenance View**: A reset button filters the table to show only actively maintained projects by default.
- **Data Sync**: A refresh button updates the table with any new entries and saves manual edits to ensure data integrity.
- **Retro vibes**: Based on the iconic windows 95 look to boost productivity
