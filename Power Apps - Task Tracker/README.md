## Problem Statement

Teams often juggle multiple tools and spreadsheets to manage tasks, which leads to duplicated effort, stale data, missed deadlines, and unclear ownership. We need a simple, centralized app where everyone can **create**, **assign**, **track**, and **complete** tasks—while giving managers a quick view of priorities and throughput.

  A Canvas app styled with Modern/Fluent controls to feel like a model‑driven app: header, left navigation, compact data grids, and consistent theming.

- **Core Screens**
  - **Home (KPI Dashboard)**: instant metrics and charts.
  - **All Open / All Completed**: global views for oversight.
  - **My Open / My Completed**: personal queues for focus.
