## Problem statement

End users receive two separate reports, both containing essential data needed for their workflow. 
Manually combining and analyzing these reports is time-consuming and prone to error.

## Solution & Features

- **Data Integration**: Combines both source reports into a single, consolidated dataset.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Applies user-requested cleaning and transformations to standardize fields and remove duplicates/inconsistencies.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Uses Excel slicers for intuitive filtering of key fields like status, banding, and owner.
- **User-Friendly Report**: Summarizes important account information in a clear, actionable format.
