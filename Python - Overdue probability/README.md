# Overdue classification (Logistic Regression)

## Problem statement

Finance teams need to identify which invoices are likely to become overdue to proactively manage credit risk and collections. Manual rules are often simplistic and hard to maintain, while black-box models lack transparency.

## Solution & Features

- **Baseline Model**: Trains a Logistic Regression classifier on preprocessed invoice features to predict overdue status.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to assess model performance.
- **Interpretability**: Surfaces feature coefficients and odds ratios to explain model behavior.
- **Actionable Outputs**: Saves predictions, feature effects, and ROC curve for reporting and downstream use.
